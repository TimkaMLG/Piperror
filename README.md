# Piperror

Piperror is a coding game in which the player needs to set a sequence of commands so that the ball does not hit any obstacle.

## How to use

- You need to open the application and press the "Play" button. After that a scene with a choice of levels will appear.
- After you have selected a level and navigated to it, a scene with the level itself appears. The red line marks the terminal, which will have 5 fields (so far there are only 2), which correspond to time steps.

- For each obstacle in the terminal, its own sequence of actions is set (to set commands for a certain obstacle, you must click on this object).
- In each field, one of three commands is selected: turn clockwise, counterclockwise and stop. You can switch these commands by pressing the field again. It is necessary to achieve such a sequence of actions so that the ball does not crash into any of the obstacles.
